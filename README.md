HalloChristkind
===============

**Twitter, Facebook, Python, PHP, SQLite3, and a Thermal Printer = this.**

This is the result of a little project called “Hallo Christkind”.

In December 2012, we printed every message on our Facebook wall or ever mention on Twitter on a Thermal Printer. Those messages where wishes to “Santa”. After printing, we sent those out to him. :-)

I never planned to release this code, so there is no documentation or anything else. Feel free to browse it, though.

*fetchFacebook* is getting the data from a specific Facebook page and puts it into the SQLite3 database.
*fetchTwitter* does the same for Twitter mentions to a specific account.
*Printer.py* is a wrapper for the Citizen CBM-231 Thermal Printer (boy, it was a pain in the ass to get this thingy working!).

That’s it, enjoy!
